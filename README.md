# WorkDayPlanner

### In this project, we are using Javascript libraries such as Moment.js and jquery, as well as Bootstrap, to create a Work Day Planner. This planner will contain your hourly activites and store it in the planner. Tasks will be inputed by selecting the text area and typing in the tasks in the specific slot. Then click the save button to save the tasks in local storage. At the current hour of the day, the tasks in that specific hour will be highlighted. Tasks in the future will be highlighted green to indicate for upcoming tasks and tasks in the past will be greyed out to indicate for past tasks. The current date is displayed in the header to let the user know what day it is.
